# Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in a College Campus using Edge AI

## Introduction

This project leverages AI and edge computing to manage vehicle movement and parking on a college campus. We use TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) and my_ssd_mobnet for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), and the SuperGradients library for parking space detection. Models are optimized with TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for real-time edge deployment.

## Objectives

1. Develop a robust ANPR system.
2. Implement parking space detection and recognition.
3. Deploy models on edge devices using TFLite.
4. Analyze vehicle movement and parking patterns.

## Problem Statement

College campuses struggle with high traffic volumes and limited parking. Our project aims to create a scalable AI-powered system for real-time vehicle movement analysis and parking management, enhancing traffic flow and providing actionable insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and annotate the dataset.
2. **Model Training:** Train ANPR and parking space detection models.
3. **Model Optimization:** Convert models to TFLite.
4. **Edge Deployment:** Deploy models on edge devices.
5. **Evaluation:** Test models for performance, accuracy, and reliability.

## Results

- High accuracy in ANPR and parking space detection.
- Real-time processing with TFLite on edge devices.
- Comprehensive insights into vehicle movement and parking utilization.
